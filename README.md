# My Favorite Homeowner

A full stack web application made for contractors to review the homeowners they work for. Designed to give power back to the working man, this app acts like Home Advisor or Yelp for the contractor. They can see if homeowners they give estimates to are rated highly, and adjust for the job accordingly. Homeowners want to get good reviews to receive more bids at competitive prices.

This app was built using HTML/CSS, Bootstrap and Light Bootstrap Dashbboard, JavaScript, Node Js, Express Js, MySQL, Sequelize, and Firebase for user login and authentication.
